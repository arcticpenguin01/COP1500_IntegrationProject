# Required components
# number != 3   comparison operator
# number > 3 this is a boolean relational operation and it reads "number is greater than 3"

# number = 4
# print(number < 1 and number > 4) returns true if both conditions are true (in this case will return False)

# number = 3
# print(number < 1 or number < 4) returns true if either condition is true (in this case will return True)

# number = 3
# print( number == 4) returns true if condition is false ( in this case it will return True)
